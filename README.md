OPNsense GUI and system management
==================================

The OPNsense project invites developers to start contributing to
the code base.  For your own purpose or even better to join us in
creating the best open source firewall available.

The build process has been designed to make it truly straightforward
and easy for anyone to build and code.  Being able to get the sources
and build it yourself is one of the key factors of open source software.

Although a lot of the code is still in flux, we try to publish the
direction we're taking on our wiki page.  The main outline of the new
codebase is available at:

https://wiki.opnsense.org/index.php/Develop:Architecture

Our aim is to gradually evolve to a new codebase instead of using a
big bang approach into something new.

Build tools
===========

To create working software like OPNsense you need the sources and the
tools to build it.  The build tools for OPNsense are freely available.
No strings attached.
