OPNsense GUI and system management

The OPNsenseÂ® project invites developers to start developing with OPNsense. For your own purpose or even better to join us in creating the best open source firewall available.

The build process has been redesigned to make it lot more straightforward and easy for developers to build OPNsense. Being able to get the sources and build it yourself is one of the key factors of open source software. 

Although a lot of the code is still legacy, we try to publish the direction we're taking on our wiki page. 
The main outline of the new codebase is available there at https://wiki.opnsense.org/index.php/Develop:Architecture
Our aim is to gradually evolve to a new codebase instead of using a big bang approach into something new. 

# Build tools

To create working software like OPNsense you need the sources and the tools to build it. The build tools for OPNsense are freely available. No strings attached.     

Notes on how to build OPNsense can be found in the tools repository at https://github.com/opnsense/tools
