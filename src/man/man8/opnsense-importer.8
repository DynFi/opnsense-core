.Sh NAME
.Nm opnsense-importer
.Nd OPNsense import utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bz
.Op Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can import a previous configuration from multiple types of
disk formats.
A normal system directory layout using
.Pa /conf
is expected with at least
.Pa /conf/config.xml
present.
If successful, the old configuration will be replaced.
.Pp
The
.Ar disk
selection allows the user to escape to a shell by issuing
.Sq \&!
instead.
This shell can be used to e.g. start an early install process using
.Xr opnsense-installer 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl b" -offset indent
.It Fl b
Run the importer in boot mode, which only triggers the import timeout
prompt when no current configuration is found in the system.
This mode is used for install media duties to allow early configuration
imports to be able to live-boot into them afterwards.
.It Fl z
List all available ZFS pools in the system and exit.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr opnsense-installer 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in OPNsense 17.1.4.
It was derived from code written for the
.Xr opnsense-installer 8
utility.
