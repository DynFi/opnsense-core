Configuration of local syslog-ng targets.

These configuration files should use a strict format in order to be properly supported and should only contain filter criteria.

The filter clause itself, defines which local log traffic should be captured.
A strict format is required here. f_local_[filename without .conf]. (e.g. f_local_configd for configd.conf)

All of these files are combined into a large configuration file defining a target per local file and a system log
file containing all not catched in the local definitions.
A local target named system is therefor not allowed here.

Underscores will be replaced as path reference, app_file.conf will result in a file /var/log/app/file/file_[XX].log
