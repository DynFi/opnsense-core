<p>Dear friends and followers,</p>
<p>This is the EOL announcement for the 16.7 series of OPNsense. As such it
will not receive any more updates, but the upgrade to the new 17.1 series is
seamless, except for the following points:</p>
<p><ul><li>The integrated authentication framework is now used as a system-wide
default including login(1), su(1) and sudo(8). This means that e.g. 2FA
will be used for low-level password prompts as well and plain passwords are
disabled by default. If this behaviour is undesired, set the "Disable
integrated authentication" option under System: Settings: Administration.</li>
<li>The console settings received a non-backwards compatible change. If the
VGA console is not working, simply reconfigure it from System: Settings:
Administration as it was likely set to "Serial" due to a wrong GUI default.</li>
<li>FreeBSD 11.0 switched to the vt(4) console driver, but we are keeping
sc(4) as the default. You can change this after installation by enabling the
virtual terminal driver under System: Settings: Administration.</li>
<li>The access privileges for "Lobby: Login / Logout / Dashboard" and
"Diagnostics: Backup / Restore" have been remapped internally and need to be
reapplied when they have been assigned explicitly.</li>
<li>The inherited 6rd kernel patches are not included in standard FreeBSD
11.0. The state of 6rd is possibly broken. We ask for volunteers to pick up
the work if 6rd is still a requirement, as we do not have access to such
setups.</li>
<li>Fundamental WiFi stack changes in FreeBSD 11.0 could still affect overall
operability. Please let us know about these right away.</li>
<li>The following services moved to individual plugins and need to be
reinstalled in order to be used: SNMP, Load Balancer, Wake on LAN, Universal
Plug and Play, IGMP Proxy. Their respective configurations will be preserved
by the system even if these plugins are not installed.</li>
<li>The Intel e1000 driver plugin has been removed due to an incompatibility
with FreeBSD 11.0. All previously known bugs of the FreeBSD 11.0 e1000 driver
have been fixed in OPNsense 17.1 and reported to FreeBSD.</li> </ul></p>
<p>We would like to encourage everyone to supervise this major upgrade physically.
As such, it cannot be performed from the GUI. Instead, go to the root console
menu, choose option 12 and type "17.1" at the prompt. The process will download
a full set of updates and reboot multiple. All operating system files and packages
will be reinstalled as a consequence. This process can also be remotely triggered
via SSH.</p>
<p> Another method is to import and reinstall using a new installation image,
which will retain your settings (selecting "Import Configuration"), then
reformat the disk and apply a clean system (selecting "Guided Installation").</p>
<p>Please heed these points carefully before upgrading. Backup your configs,
preview the new version via the live CD or in a virtual machine. Create
snapshots. If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnsense.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance. You don't have to do this on your own. :)</p>
<p><em>Dancing Dolphin</em>, you've served us well.</p>
<p>See you on the other side,<br>Your OPNsense team</p>
