<p>Dearest user,</p>
<p>This is the EOL announcement for the 16.1 series of OPNsense.  As such it
will not receive any more updates, but the upgrade to the new 16.7 series is
seamless, except for the following points:</p>
<p><ul><li>The FreeBSD version changes from 10.2 to 10.3, mainly for driver
updates and general sanity.  Due to kernel interface changes <strong>plugins
or custom-built kernel modules may stop working</strong>.  Reinstalling the
offending packages from the firmware pages or recompiling custom additions
against the <em>stable/16.7</em> source branch will resolve this
problem.</li>
<li>Legacy VPN Servers for L2TP, PPPoE, and PPTP moved to plugins and need
to be installed in order to still make use of them.  Your configurations
will persist, but may have to be adapted to adhere to the requirements of
the MPD5 server daemon.  The most important change is that your listening
address needs to be a known address, preferrably using a Virtual IP from
the firewall settings.</li>
<li>The <em>Maximum MSS</em> option for VPN Networks moved to <em>Firewall:
Settings: Normalization</em>, which can now be specified per interface and
network.</li>
<li>The <em>Disable firewall scrub</em> option was removed.  All scrubbing
(including MSS clamping) can now be disabled using the <em>Disable interface
scrub</em> option under <em>Firewall: Settings: Normalization</em>
<li>The <em>NAT+proxy</em> reflection option was removed and will
automatically switch to the more flexible firewall-based NAT.</li>
<li>The <em>IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling</em> option was removed.  You can use
a regular NAT rule to achieve the same result.</li></ul></p>
<p>Please heed these points carefully before upgrading.  Backup your configs,
preview the new version via the live CD or in a virtual machine.  Create
snapshots.  If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnsense.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance.  You don't have to do this on your own.  :)</p>
<p><em>Crafty Coyote</em>, you've served us well.</p>
<p>See you on the other side,<br>Your OPNsense team</p>
