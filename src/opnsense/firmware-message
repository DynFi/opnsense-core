<p>Dearest user,</p>
<p>This is the EOL announcement for the 16.1 series of OPNsense.  As such it
will not receive any more updates, but the upgrade to the new 16.7 series is
seamless, except for the following points:</p>
<p><ul><li>The FreeBSD version changes from 10.2 to 10.3, mainly for driver
updates and general sanity.  Due to kernel interface changes <strong>plugins
or custom-built kernel modules may stop working</strong>.  Reinstalling the
offending packages from the firmware pages or recompiling custom additions
against the <em>stable/16.7</em> source branch will resolve this
problem.</li>
<li>Legacy VPN Servers for L2TP, PPPoE, and PPTP moved to plugins and need
to be installed in order to still make use of them.  Your configurations
will persist, but may have to be adapted to adhere to the requirements of
the MPD5 server daemon.  The most important change is that your listening
address needs to be a known address, preferably using a Virtual IP from
the firewall settings.</li>
<li>The PPTP server redirection mode has been removed.  It can be emulated
by the two following NAT port forward rules: <em>From incoming WAN interface,
redirect all traffic to PPTP server IP target for protocol GRE.  From
incoming WAN interface redirect all traffic to PPTP server IP target for
protocol TCP, port 1723.</em>  Note that due to the design of GRE, only one
server can be reached by incoming clients at any given time.</li>
<li>The <em>Maximum MSS</em> option for VPN Networks moved to <em>Firewall:
Settings: Normalization</em>, which can now be specified per interface and
network.</li>
<li>The <em>Disable firewall scrub</em> option was removed.  All scrubbing
(including MSS clamping) can now be disabled using the <em>Disable interface
scrub</em> option under <em>Firewall: Settings: Normalization</em>
<li>The <em>NAT+proxy</em> reflection option was removed and will
automatically switch to the more flexible firewall-based NAT.</li>
<li>Due to lack of support in FreeBSD itself, the floating rules actions
can no longer use <em>match</em>.  The custom kernel patch that previously
enabled selection of this behaviour has been removed.</li>
<li>The <em>Disable Negate rule on policy routing rules</em> option is no
longer available as automatic VPN skip rules for policy-based routing have
been removed.  If you want to skip your VPN, please add an explicit rule.</li>
<li>The <em>IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling</em> option was removed.  You can use
a regular NAT rule to achieve the same result.</li></ul></p>
<p>Please heed these points carefully before upgrading.  Backup your configs,
preview the new version via the live CD or in a virtual machine.  Create
snapshots.  If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnsense.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance.  You don't have to do this on your own.  :)</p>
<p><em>Crafty Coyote</em>, you've served us well.</p>
<p>See you on the other side,<br>Your OPNsense team</p>
