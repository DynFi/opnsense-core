<p>Hello trusty friend,</p>
<p>As with all things in life, the 15.7 series of OPNsense is nearing its
inevitable end. As such it will not receive any more updates, but the
upgrade to the new 16.1 series is seamless, except for the following
points:</p>
<p><ul><li>The FreeBSD version changes from 10.1 to 10.2, mainly for driver
updates and general sanity. <strong>If you're running Hyper-V, your installed
disk may change from <em>/dev/ada0</em> to <em>/dev/da0</em> and the system
will not boot as a consequence</strong>. You can fix this by manually editing
<em>/etc/fstab</em> before performing the major upgrade. A reinstall using the
import configuration and quick/easy install will work just as well.</li>
<li>The captive portal implementation has been completely rewritten.
<strong>Your old setup won't be converted and thus will not come back
up</strong>. Reconfiguring the captive portal, however, will be relatively
easy.</li></ul></p>
<p>Please heed these points carefully before upgrading. Backup your configs,
preview the new version via the live CD or in a virtual machine. Create
snapshots. If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnsense.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance. You don't have to do this on your own. :)</p>
<p><em>Brave Badger</em>, you've served us well.</p>
<p>See you on the other side,<br>Your OPNsense team</p>
