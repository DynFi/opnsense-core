# Files are sorted and should adhere to the following
# rule of thumb: "dd-identifier", for core package
# loader.conf chunks should generally use something
# like "20-mycorevars" and for plugin packages rather
# "50-mypluginvars".
#
# It could be useful for the user to order variables
# or set a higher/lower priority in case some
# use case requires a slightly different setup.
