# a problem for us as su(1) assumes the root shell and has no
# way to override it because the target user most likely does
# not have a shell set.
#
# Worse still, su(1) *is* root, but changes to the selected user ID
# so it creates its own downfall by selecting the root shell to do it.
# On OpenBSD, su(1) does have the `-s' parameter to override the shell.
# FreeBSD has the '-s' parameter as well, but it is completely
# unrelated and the desired functionality does not actually exist.  :(
