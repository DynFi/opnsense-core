Contributing to OPNsense
========================

Thanks for considering a pull request or issue report.  Below are a
few hints and tips in order to make them as effective as possible.

Issue reports
-------------

Issue reports can be bug reports or feature requests.  Make sure to
search the issues before adding a new one.  It is often better to
join ongoing discussions on similar issues than creating a new one
as there may be workarounds or ideas available.

When creating bug reports, please make sure you provide the following:

* Current OPNsense version where the bug first appeared
* The last OPNsense version where the bug did not appear
* The exact URL of the GUI page involved (if any)
* A list of steps to replicate the bug

All issues reported will have to be triaged and prioritised.  As we
are a small time we may not always have the time to implement and help,
but reporting an issue may help others to fill in.

Feature requests that are in line with project goals will eventually
be added to our roadmap:

https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/

Feature requests beyond the scope of OPNsense may still be doable using
the plugin framework:

https://github.com/opnsense/plugins

Stale issues are timed out after a few months of inactivity.

And above all: stay kind and open.  :)

Pull requests
-------------

When creating pull request, please heed these points:

* Base your code on the latest master branch to avoid manual merges.
* Code review may ensue in order to help shape your proposal.
* Pull request must adhere to 2-Clause BSD licensing.
* Explain the problem and your proposed solution.
